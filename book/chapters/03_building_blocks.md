# Building Blocks

This section will take you through some of the foundational elements of confidential computing.

## Root of Trust (RoT)

**A Root of Trust** is an essential, foundational security component that provides a set of trustworthy functions that the rest of the device or system can use to establish strong levels of security.

*[Trusted Computing Group What is a Root of Trust?](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/about/what-is-a-root-of-trust-rot/)*


### Functions a RoT Provides

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| **Trusted Boot** | Ensures only authorized software starts |
| **Measurement** | Records what software ran (in a tamper-proof way) |
| **Secure Storage** | Stores cryptographic keys isolated from system software |
| **Reporting** | Produces signed attestation reports |
| **Verification** | Validates other components' integrity |

Example RoTs - AMD Platform Security Processor, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM), Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE)

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and vTPM

TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is a computer chip (microcontroller) that can securely store artifacts used to authenticate the platform (your PC or laptop). These artifacts can include passwords, certificates, or encryption keys. A TPM can also be used to store platform measurements that help ensure that the platform remains trustworthy.

A Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) is a software-based representation of a physical Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 chip

*[Trusted Computing Group TPM summary](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/trusted-platform-module-tpm-summary/)*

### TPM Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)

PCRs are special registers inside a TPM where measurements (hashes) are stored. They can only be **extended** (not overwritten):

```
New_PCR_Value = SHA256(Old_PCR_Value || New_Measurement)
```

| PCR | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| 0 | UEFI firmware |
| 1 | UEFI firmware configuration |
| 4 | Boot manager |
| 7 | Secure Boot policy |
| 8-15 | OS/application measurements |

:::{warning}
A vTPM managed by a hypervisor means the hypervisor is in the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). If the hypervisor is compromised, the vTPM's protections can be bypassed. This is addressed by putting the vTPM *inside* the TEE using technologies like SVSM.

## Trusted Computing Base (TCB)

The **Trusted Computing Base** is the set of all hardware, firmware, and software components that you *must trust* for your system's security to hold. In a traditional cloud VM, this includes the hypervisor and host OS — both controlled by the cloud provider.

## Secure Boot, Trusted Boot, and Measured Boot

### Secure Boot and Trusted Boot

**Secure Boot** verifies digital signatures before running bootloaders.

- It is a feature of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). It's used to check bootloaders, key operating system files, and the ROM for any tampering attempts.
- UEFI firmware has signatures stored in a database and Secure Boot will check those signatures. If the signatures don't match, then something was modified incorrectly and the boot process will halt.

**Trusted Boot** extends this with a chain of verification — each stage checks the next before passing control.

- The bootloader (which we've verified to be trustworthy) will check the digital signature of the operating system kernel before loading it.
- The verified kernel will then verify every other part of the OS startup process including boot drivers and startup files, to make sure those components are all safe.

### Measured Boot

Measured boot uses hardware Root of Trust (RoT) eg. TPM to record a cryptographic hash of every stage of the boot process into PCRs. This creates a tamper-evident audit trail that can be verified remotely at any point in time.

Measured Boot doesn't *block* anything — instead it **records** everything that runs (eg. into the TPM's PCRs). This enables **remote attestation** — a third party can cryptographically verify the exact software stack that booted.

### Summary Comparison

Comparison of boot security mechanisms: Secure Boot and Trusted Boot prevent unauthorized software from running; Measured Boot records what ran and enables remote verification via attestation.

## Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)

A **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** is a hardware-enforced, isolated region of a processor that protects code and data from unauthorized access — including from privileged software like the OS, hypervisor, or firmware.

```{figure} ../images/page_22.png
:alt: Trusted Execution Environments definition
:align: center
```

| Characteristic | Description |
|---|---|
| **Memory Encryption** | All data in the TEE's memory is encrypted by the hardware. Even physical DRAM access reveals only ciphertext. |
| **Isolation** | The TEE is isolated from other processes, VMs, and the host OS. Hardware enforces this boundary. |
| **Remote Attestation** | The TEE can prove its identity and integrity to remote parties cryptographically. |
| **Data Integrity** | The hardware detects and prevents tampering with TEE memory. |

### Types of TEEs

```{figure} ../images/page_23.png
:alt: Types of TEEs — VM-based and Process-based
:align: center
```

**VM-Based TEEs** encrypt memory along a traditional VM boundary. The hypervisor cannot read VM memory.

Examples: AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, IBM Secure Execution, IBM PEF

- Protects entire existing applications without code changes
- Supports standard Linux distributions
- Scales to large memory and multi-core workloads

**Process-Based TEEs** split an app into trusted and untrusted components. Only the sensitive part runs in encrypted memory.

Example: Intel SGX

- Smaller attack surface (only enclave code is in the TCB)
- Requires application refactoring to separate trusted/untrusted components
- Historically constrained to small enclave memory sizes

### TCB Reduction with Confidential Computing

Confidential Computing dramatically reduces the TCB. The hypervisor and host OS move out of the TCB — you no longer need to trust the cloud provider's software stack.

#### TCB for VM TEEs with vTPM

```{figure} ../images/page_25.png
:alt: TCB for VM TEEs with vTPM — two configurations
:align: center
```

| Configuration | vTPM Location | Hypervisor in TCB? | Used By |
|---|---|---|---|
| vTPM outside TEE | Managed by hypervisor | ✔ Yes | AWS (SNP), GCP |
| vTPM inside TEE (SVSM) | Inside the CVM | ✗ No | Azure CVMs, bare metal |

#### TCB for VM TEEs without vTPM

When no vTPM is used (direct boot model for SNP/TDX), the hypervisor is excluded from the TCB entirely. The hardware Root of Trust generates attestation reports directly.

```{figure} ../images/page_26.png
:alt: TCB for VM TEEs without vTPM
:align: center
```

#### TCB for AMD VM TEEs with SVSM

**SVSM** (Secure VM Service Module) runs *inside* the TEE and provides hypervisor-like services (such as vTPM) without involving the hypervisor itself. This means even the cloud provider's hypervisor is excluded from the TCB.

```

### AMD SEV-SNP Measured Boot

QEMU injects hashes of kernel, cmdline, and initramfs into guest memory. The AMD Secure Processor measures all guest memory. OVMF verifies hashes before booting. Measurements are in the VCEK-signed attestation report. No TPM is required.

```{figure} ../images/page_28.png

```

### Intel TDX Measured Boot

OVMF extends RTMRs (Runtime Extendable Measurement Registers) with kernel, cmdline, and initramfs measurements during boot.
Measurements are available in the event log for remote attestation via TD Quote. No TPM required.

### Summary - TPM vs. No-TPM Attestation

```{figure} ../images/page_30.png

```

| | With TPM | Without TPM (SNP/TDX direct boot) |
|---|---|---|
| **Measurements** | PCRs | Specific memory locations (SNP) / RTMRs (TDX) |
| **Evidence** | PCR Quote + event log | Attestation report / event log |
| **Secret unsealing** | PCR authorization in hardware | External authorization + policy |

### Summary Comparison of x86 TEE Technologies
