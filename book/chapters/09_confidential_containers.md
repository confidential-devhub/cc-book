# Confidential Containers (CoCo)

## What Are Confidential Containers?

Confidential Containers — a generic term for containers deployed inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

> *"The CNCF CoCo project aims to enable users to run containers inside TEEs on any Kubernetes cluster, with minimal changes to their existing applications and workflows."*

## CNCF Confidential Containers (CoCo) Project

The CNCF CoCo project provides a common foundation for deploying containers inside VM (using [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/)) on any Kubernetes cluster, and includes Trustee as the remote attestation service.

CoCo provides two deployment approaches:

1. Confidential containers using VM-based TEEs on a local hypervisor
2. Confidential containers using VM-based TEEs on a remote hypervisor (peer-pods)

## From Kata to CoCo: The Key Difference

Kata Containers **protects the host from the workload**.

CoCo **protects the workload from the host**.

| | Kata Containers | CoCo |
|---|---|---|
| **Threat model** | Host ← Workload | Host → Workload |
| **Who's protected** | Infrastructure | The application |
| **Image download** | On worker node | Inside the CVM |
| **Secrets via** | K8s Secrets (etcd) | Sealed Secrets (attestation) |
| **TEE required** | No | Yes |
| **Attestation** | No | Yes |

## Architecture: CoCo/bare-metal (Local Hypervisor)

The Confidential VM (CVM) runs on the worker node inside the TEE hardware. Inside the CVM: kata-agent manages containers, image-rs downloads encrypted images, the Confidential Data Hub (CDH) serves as the secret retrieval proxy, and the Attestation Agent (AA) produces hardware-backed evidence. Container images are always downloaded inside the CVM, never on the host.

## Architecture: CoCo/peer-pods (Remote Hypervisor)

The Confidential VM runs external to the worker node. The worker node hosts only the kata-runtime and cloud-api-adaptor. The CVM handles all TEE operations, attestation, and encrypted image downloads.

## CoCo Threat Model

The untrusted components include the host OS, KVM hypervisor, cloud provider software, other VMs on the same host, other processes on the host machine, and the Kubernetes control plane (kubelet, etcd, API server).

Application code vulnerabilities, availability attacks, and software TEEs are out of scope.

## Integrity Protection for CoCo CVM Images

Dm-verity protected read-only OS rootfs prevents tampering with the CVM image. The kernel, kernel cmd line, and initrd are measured and included in the attestation report. Any change to the OS image changes the measurements, causing attestation to fail.

## CoCo CVM Requirements

Following are the key CVM requirements for CoCo:

1. Read-only rootfs with integrity protection (dm-verity/fs-verity + composefs)
2. Memory-backed filesystem or LUKS-encrypted ephemeral disk for read-write storage (container images)

### Read-Only Rootfs with Integrity Protection

- **dm-verity** — Linux kernel feature providing transparent integrity checking of block devices
- **fs-verity** — file-level integrity verification
- **composefs** — combining read-only fs-verity protected files with a mutable upper layer

### Encrypted Ephemeral Disk

For container image layers and ephemeral writes, a **LUKS-encrypted disk** uses an **ephemeral key** generated inside the TEE at runtime — never persisted, never leaving the TEE.
